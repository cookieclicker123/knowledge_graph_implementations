# Sample Document for LightRAG Example 02

## Introduction

This document serves as a sample input for the second LightRAG example. 
The purpose is to demonstrate processing text content read directly from a file,
rather than using a hardcoded string within the script.

## Key Concepts

The core idea remains Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We still leverage 
an embedding model (like OpenAI's) to represent the text numerically and an 
LLM (like GPT-4o Mini) to generate answers based on retrieved context.

LightRAG helps orchestrate this process, managing storage, retrieval, and generation.
It uses components like Vector Databases (e.g., NanoVectorDB for local storage) 
and potentially Knowledge Graphs to structure and access information efficiently.

## Processing Steps (Conceptual)

1.  **Read:** The script will open and read the entire content of this `.txt` file.
2.  **Insert:** The read text will be passed to `rag.ainsert()`. LightRAG internally handles chunking, embedding, entity/relationship extraction (if configured), and storage.
3.  **Store:** Data (embeddings, chunks, metadata) will be saved in a specific working directory (`LightRAG/tmp/lightrag_data/02_document_example/`).
4.  **Query:** A user query will be embedded.
5.  **Retrieve:** Relevant chunks/entities will be retrieved from the stored data based on the query embedding.
6.  **Generate:** The LLM will use the retrieved context and the original query to generate a final answer.

## Conclusion

This simple text file allows us to test the file reading and processing pipeline before moving on to more complex formats like PDF.
